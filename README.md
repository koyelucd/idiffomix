A hidden Markov model approach for identifying differentially methylated 
sites and regions for beta-valued DNA methylation data. The workflow consists
of 3 main functions:
\itemize{
\item betaHMM: to estimate the hidden Markov model parameters and the 
hidden methylation states of each CpG sites.
\item dmc_identification: uses the output from the above function to identify
CpG sites that are mostly differentially methylated between DNA samples 
collected from \eqn{R} conditions.
\item dmr_identification: to identify adjacent DMCs forming DMRs.
}

A typical call to betaHMM to apply the Baum-Welch algorithm and Viterbi 
algorithm takes the following form:
```
library(betaHMM)
### read the methylation file and annotation file
data(sample_methylation_file)
head(sample_methylation_file)
data(sample_annotation_file)
head(sample_annotation_file)
betaHMM_out <- betaHMM(sample_methylation_file,
                                sample_annotation_file,
                                M = 3,
                                N = 4,
                                R = 2,
                                parallel_process = FALSE,
                                seed = 321,
                                treatment_group = c("Benign","Tumour"))
```
where `M` represents the number of methylation state in a DNA sample, `N`
represents the number of subjects or DNA replicates, `R` represents the number
of conditions from where DNA is extracted.

A typical call to dmc_identification takes the following form:
```
dmc_out <- dmc_identification(betaHMM_out)
dmc_df <- assay(dmc_out)
```

A typical call to dmr_identification takes the following form:
```
dmr_out <- dmr_identification(dmc_out)
dmr_df <- assay(dmr_out)
```


The output of the `betaHMM` function is an
S4 object of class `betaHMMResults`, the output of the `dmc_identification`
function is an S4 object of class `dmcResults` and the output of the 
`dmr_identification` function is an S4 object of class `dmrResults` 
on which standard `plot` and `summary` functions can be directly applied; 
the former uses functionalities from the 
[ggplot2]( https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) package.
